# Lending Club Case Study
> Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.
The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment..

## General Information

- Background : Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.

- Business Problem: The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

- Approach: We are concerned about determining the driver variable for 'defaulters'. This is the case of prediction rather than projection where we are more interested in predicting the key driver variables and their impact rather than forcasting the results.

- Dataset used: Data dictionary and loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011


## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis: Applicant having address state as NE re more predictive to be defaulter
- Conclusion 2 from the analysis: Applicant having small business are more predictive to be defaulter
- Conclusion 3 from the analysis: Applicant having sub grades from E1 to to G5 are more predictive to be defaulter
- Conclusion 4 from the analysis: Applicant having interest rate more than 19.16% are more predictive to be defaulter though the relationship is not very strong but can be predicted
- Conclusion 5 from the analysis: Applicants whose last total payment amount received is less than 300 are more predictive to be defaulters
- Conclusion 6 from the analysis: Applicants whose post charge off gross recovery are more predictive to be defaulters
- Conclusion 7 from the analysis: Applicants who has more number of derogatory public record are more predictive to be defaulters
